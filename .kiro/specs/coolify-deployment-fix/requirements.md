# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical deployment issues with the Laravel application on Coolify. The deployment is currently failing due to Node.js version incompatibility and Bootstrap import path issues during the build process. The solution needs to ensure the application builds successfully and deploys properly on Coolify's infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Laravel application to build successfully during Coolify deployment, so that the application can be deployed without build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process runs `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete the build without errors
2. WHEN Vite processes the CSS files THEN the system SHALL resolve all import paths correctly
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate all necessary production assets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Node.js version compatibility issues resolved, so that all npm packages work correctly during deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment uses Node.js 18 THEN the system SHALL handle version warnings gracefully
2. WHEN npm packages have engine requirements THEN the system SHALL either use compatible versions or configure overrides
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL not fail due to engine compatibility issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Bootstrap styles to be properly imported and processed, so that the application's styling works correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CSS build process runs THEN the system SHALL resolve Bootstrap import paths correctly
2. WHEN Bootstrap CSS is imported THEN the system SHALL use the correct file path format
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display all Bootstrap styles properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment configuration optimized for Coolify, so that future deployments are reliable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL include proper environment variable handling
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate build settings for production
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear success indicators
